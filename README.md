[![npm Package Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/ga-island.svg?maxAge=2592000)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ga-island)

Simplified implementation with zero dependency.

[Demo website](https://ga-island-demo.surge.sh)

Inspired from [panchishin/geneticalgorithm](https://github.com/panchishin/geneticalgorithm)

## Features

- [x] Typescript Typing
- [x] Support custom methods to improve efficiency
- [x] Support dynamic adjustment on mutation rate
- [x] Niche Island Support (anti-competitor to encourage diversity)
- [x] Utilize multi-processor to speed up

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { RequiredOptions, GaIsland, best } from 'ga-island'

type Gene = {
  pattern: string
}

let options: RequiredOptions<Gene> = {
  populationSize: 100, // should be even number, default 100
  randomIndividual: (): Gene => ({ pattern: '...' }),
  mutationRate: 0.5, // chance of mutation, otherwise will do crossover, default 0.5
  mutate: (input: Gene, output: Gene): void => {
    output.pattern = '...'
  },
  crossover: (aParent: Gene, bParent: Gene, child: Gene): void => {
    output.pattern = '...'
  },
  fitness: (gene: Gene) => 1, // higher is better
  doesABeatB: (a: Gene, b: Gene): boolean => true, // default only compare by fitness, custom function can consider both distance and fitness
  random: Math.random, // optional, return floating number from 0 to 1 inclusively
}

let ga = new GaIsland(options)
for (let generation = 1; generation <= 100; generation++) {
  ga.evolve()
  let { gene, fitness } = best(ga.options)
  console.log({ generation, fitness, gene })
}
```

## Remark

[panchishin/geneticalgorithm](https://github.com/panchishin/geneticalgorithm) is a non-traditional genetic algorithm implementation.

It doesn't sort the population by fitness when evolving into next generation.

Instead, it randomly picks a pair of 'parent genes',
and randomly choose one 'parent' to become the 'child',
and merge two 'parents' into another 'child'.

In `ga-island`, only the 'stronger parent' in the pair can survive to next generation. Another child is the mutation result of the 'stronger parent', or the crossover result of the 'stronger parent' and another random parent.

Also, in `panchishin/geneticalgorithm`, the mutation v.s. crossover probability is 50%,
which is much higher than traditional setting where mutation is relative rare.
(Custom probability is supported in `ga-island`)

## Performance

To better speed up the evolution iteration,
the fitness of the population can be calculated in multiple processes or threads.

However, node.js doesn't allow shared memory across process,
the IO cost may become the bottleneck. Therefore, you're recommended to use worker threads when it is supported in your node version.
